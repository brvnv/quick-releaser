## Introduction
As I'm learning Java, I remember once one of the DC++ comrades looking for some script that got a txt file as parameter and added all the releases from there to the network.

Of course I had to challenge myself to create this...
My initial idea was not even to make it fully funtional quickly, but I encountered so many things that I need to learn so it can at least print the output to the console that a fully functional program could be done.

## How to use
Create any txt file. Put the release category within the brackets then go.
It would be very dumb if it was just that... You can add multiple releases to the same category too. Just check the sample file.
